### High school graduation project
#### Creation and visualization of the biography of Mikhail Afanasyevich Bulgakov in the form of a graph 
To run the project, you need to install some links:
  - CefSharp
  - Neo4jClient
  - Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel

You can install these links through Visual Studio using the NuGet Package Manager.
You also need to install Neo4jDesktop and create a local graph in it.
In order to build a graph, use the test table from the for_test_inputs file if you do not have your own source table.
